==Abstract==

This BIP describes a new opcode (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) for the Bitcoin
scripting system that in combination with BIP 68 allows execution
pathways of a script to be restricted based on the age of the output
being spent.


==Summary==

CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY redefines the existing NOP3 opcode.
When executed, the script interpreter continues as if a NOP was executed
so long as one of the following conditions is met:

  * the transaction's nVersion field is 0 or 1;
  * the top item on the stack is a value greater than or equal to (1 << 31); or
  * the top item on the stack and the transaction input's sequence number are both relative lock-times of the same units, and the relative lock-time represented by the sequence number is greater than or equal to the relative lock-time represented by the top item on the stack.

Otherwise, script execution terminates with an error.

BIP 68's redefinition of nSequence prevents a non-final transaction
from being selected for inclusion in a block until the corresponding
input has reached the specified age, as measured in block height or
block time. By comparing the argument to CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY against
the nSequence field, we indirectly verify a desired minimum age of the
the output being spent; until that relative age has been reached any
script execution pathway including the CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY will fail
to validate, causing the transaction not to be selected for inclusion
in a block.


==Motivation==

BIP 68 repurposes the transaction nSequence field meaning by giving
sequence numbers new consensus-enforced semantics as a relative
lock-time. However, there is no way to build Bitcoin scripts to make
decisions based on this field.

By making the nSequence field accessible to script, it becomes
possible to construct code pathways that only become accessible some
minimum time after proof-of-publication. This enables a wide variety
of applications in phased protocols such as escrow, payment channels,
or bidirectional pegs.


===Contracts With Expiration Deadlines===

====Escrow with Timeout====

An escrow that times out automatically 30 days after being funded can be
established in the following way. Alice, Bob and Escrow create a 2-of-3
address with the following redeemscript.

    IF
        2 <Alice's pubkey> <Bob's pubkey> <Escrow's pubkey> 3 CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY
    ELSE
        "30d" CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP
        <Alice's pubkey> CHECKSIGVERIFY
    ENDIF

At any time funds can be spent using signatures from any two of Alice, 
Bob or the Escrow.

After 30 days Alice can sign alone.

The clock does not start ticking until the payment to the escrow address
confirms. 


===Retroactive Invalidation===

In many instances, we would like to create contracts that can be revoked in case
of some future event. However, given the immutable nature of the blockchain, it
is practically impossible to retroactively invalidate a previous commitment that
has already confirmed. The only mechanism we really have for retroactive
invalidation is blockchain reorganization which, for fundamental security
reasons, is designed to be very hard and very expensive to do.

Despite this limitation, we do have a way to provide something functionally similar to retroactive invalidation while preserving irreversibility of past commitments
using CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. By constructing scripts with multiple branches of
execution where one or more of the branches are delayed we provide
a time window in which someone can supply an invalidation condition that allows the
output to be spent, effectively invalidating the would-be delayed branch and potentially discouraging
another party from broadcasting the transaction in the first place. If the invalidation
condition does not occur before the timeout, the delayed branch becomes spendable,
honoring the original contract.

Some more specific applications of this idea:

====Hash Time-Locked Contracts====

Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) provide a general mechanism for offchain contract negotiation. An execution pathway can be made to require knowledge of a secret (a hash preimage) that can be presented within an invalidation time window. By sharing the secret it is possible to guarantee to the counterparty that the transaction will never be broadcast since this would allow the counterparty to claim the output immediately while one would have to wait for the time window to pass. If the secret has not been shared, the counterparty will be unable to use the instant pathway and the delayed pathway must be used instead.

====Bidirectional Payment Channels====

Scriptable relative locktime provides a predictable amount of time to respond in
the event a counterparty broadcasts a revoked transaction: Absolute locktime
necessitates closing the channel and reopen it when getting close to the timeout,
whereas with relative locktime, the clock starts ticking the moment the
transactions confirms in a block. It also provides a means to know exactly how
long to wait (in number of blocks) before funds can be pulled out of the channel
in the event of a noncooperative counterparty.


====Lightning Network====

The lightning network extends the bidirectional payment channel idea to allow for payments to be routed over multiple bidirectional payment channel hops.

These channels are based on an anchor transaction that requires a 2-of-2
multisig from Alice and Bob, and a series of revocable commitment
transactions that spend the anchor transaction.  The commitment
transaction splits the funds from the anchor between Alice and Bob and
the latest commitment transaction may be published by either party at
any time, finalising the channel.

Ideally then, a revoked commitment transaction would never be able to
be successfully spent; and the latest commitment transaction would be
able to be spent very quickly.

To allow a commitment transaction to be effectively revoked, Alice
and Bob have slightly different versions of the latest commitment
transaction. In Alice's version, any outputs in the commitment
transaction that pay Alice also include a forced delay, and an
alternative branch that allows Bob to spend the output if he knows that
transaction's revocation code. In Bob's version, payments to Bob are
similarly encumbered. When Alice and Bob negotiate new balances and
new commitment transactions, they also reveal the old revocation code,
thus committing to not relaying the old transaction.

A simple output, paying to Alice might then look like:

    HASH160 <revokehash> EQUAL
    IF
        DUP HASH160 <Bob key hash> CHECKSIGVERIFY
    ELSE
        "24h" CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
        DUP HASH160 <Alice key hash> CHECKSIGVERIFY
    ENDIF

This allows Alice to publish the latest commitment transaction at any
time and spend the funds after 24 hours, but also ensures that if Alice
relays a revoked transaction, that Bob has 24 hours to claim the funds.

With CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, this would look like:

    HASH160 <revokehash> EQUAL
    IF
        DUP HASH160 <Bob key hash> CHECKSIGVERIFY
    ELSE
        "2015/12/15" CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
        DUP HASH160 <Alice key hash> CHECKSIGVERIFY
    ENDIF

This form of transaction would mean that if the anchor is unspent on
2015/12/16, Alice can use this commitment even if it has been revoked,
simply by spending it immediately, giving no time for Bob to claim it.

Ths means that the channel has a deadline that cannot be pushed
back without hitting the blockchain; and also that funds may not be
available until the deadline is hit. CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY allows you
to avoid making such a tradeoff.

Hashed Time-Lock Contracts (HTLCs) make this slightly more complicated,
since in principle they may pay either Alice or Bob, depending on whether
Alice discovers a secret R, or a timeout is reached, but the same principle
applies -- the branch paying Alice in Alice's commitment transaction gets a
delay, and the entire output can be claimed by the other party if the
revocation secret is known. With CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, a HTLC payable to
Alice might look like the following in Alice's commitment transaction:

    HASH160 DUP <revokehash> EQUAL
    IF
        DROP DUP HASH160 <Bob key hash> CHECKSIGVERIFY
    ELSE
        <R hash> EQUAL
        IF
            "24h" CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP
            DUP HASH160 <Alice key hash> CHECKSIGVERIFY
        ELSE
            "2015/10/20 10:33" CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
            DUP HASH160 <Bob key hash> CHECKSIGVERIFY
        ENDIF
    ENDIF

and correspondingly in Bob's commitment transaction:

   HASH160 DUP <revokehash> EQUAL
   IF
       DROP DUP HASH160 <Alice key hash> CHECKSIGVERIFY
   ELSE
       <R hash> EQUAL
       IF
           DUP HASH160 <Alice key hash> CHECKSIGVERIFY
       ELSE
           "24h" CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP
           "2015/10/20 10:33" CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
           DUP HASH160 <Bob key hash> CHECKSIGVERIFY
       ENDIF
   ENDIF

Note that both CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY are used in the
final branch of above to ensure Bob cannot spend the output until after both
the timeout is complete and Alice has had time to reveal the revocation
secret.

====2-Way Pegged Sidechains====

The 2-way pegged sidechain requires a new REORGPROOFVERIFY opcode, the semantics of which are outside the scope of this BIP. CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY is used to make sure that sufficient time has passed since the return peg was posted to publish a reorg proof:

    IF
        lockTxHeight <lockTxHash> nlocktxOut [<workAmount>] reorgBounty Hash160(<...>) <genesisHash> REORGPROOFVERIFY
    ELSE
        withdrawLockTime CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP HASH160 p2shWithdrawDest EQUAL
    ENDIF


==Specification==

semantics and detailed rationale for those semantics.

     * as a relative lock-time, otherwise ignored. */
    static const uint32_t SEQUENCE_LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD = (1 << 31);
    
    /* Threshold for nSequence when interpreted as a relative
     * lock-time: below this value it has units of blocks, otherwise
     * seconds. */
    static const uint32_t SEQUENCE_UNITS_THRESHOLD = (1 << 30);

        // default 4-byte limit.
        //
        // Thus as a special case we tell CScriptNum to accept up
        // to 5-byte bignums, which are good until 2**39-1, well
        // beyond the 2**32-1 limit of the nSequence field itself.
        const CScriptNum nSequence(stacktop(-1), fRequireMinimal, 5);

    }


==Reference Implementation==

A reference implementation is provided by the following pull request:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6564


==Deployment==

We reuse the double-threshold switchover mechanism from BIPs 34 and
66, with the same thresholds, but for nVersion = 4. The new rules are
in effect for every block (at height H) with nVersion = 4 and at least
750 out of 1000 blocks preceding it (with heights H-1000..H-1) also
have nVersion = 4. Furthermore, when 950 out of the 1000 blocks
preceding a block do have nVersion = 4, nVersion = 3 blocks become
invalid, and all further blocks enforce the new rules.

It is recommended that this soft-fork deployment trigger include other 
related proposals for improving Bitcoin's lock-time capabilities, including:

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki BIP 65]: 
OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, 

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki BIP 68]: 
Consensus-enforced transaction replacement signalled via sequence numbers,

and [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki BIP 113]: 
Median-Past-Time-Lock.

==Credits==

Mark Friedenbach invented the application of sequence numbers to
achieve relative lock-time, and wrote the reference implementation of
CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.

The reference implementation and this BIP was based heavily on work
done by Peter Todd for the closely related BIP 65.
