  Title: Transaction Version 2 Specification (wildcard inputs)

==Abstract==

This specification defines a new type of transaction that supplements (not replaces)
version 1 transactions.

==Motivation==

Version 1 Bitcoin Transactions have one large inefficiency: When you want to spend
from multiple inputs with the exact same scriptPubKey, you have to list the same
signature multiple times. This bloats the transaction size and makes it expensive to spend
from small value inputs.

Because small value inputs are expensive to send, they remain in the UTXO pool
which full nodes have to keep around. It is believed that long term increase of the UTXO
set can have negative scaling consequences on the network.

==Specification==

A version 2 transaction is formulated the exact same way as a version 1 transaction
with one exception: each input is treated as a "wildcard input".

A wildcard input beings the value of all inputs with the exact same scriptPubKey
in a block lower or equal to the block the wildcard input is confirmed into.
